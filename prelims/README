These preliminary documents, programs, and files provide the necessary prerequisites
  for programming the roomba (irobot create). 

Document 01 provides good background information and an introduction to programming the roomba command module.
Document 02 provides a complete reference for the command module microprocessor.
Document 03 provides a handy reference to most of the more useful parts of document 01.

WinAVR will setup your (PC) computer for compiling programs and transferring them to the roomba command module.
  This will be unnecessary for most people, but it might help to see if your code compiles.

The avr folder contains the includes, libs, and binaries required for compiling.  The includes will be of primary interest here.
  This folder is installed with WinAVR.
